Various replica IMU datasets are available to be used in the testing of the figures of merit for the compression subsystem. Alternatively, data sets may be generated using the IMU simulation model on MatLab. The ZLIB compression algorithm will be used to compress all the various data files as well as decompression using the ZLIB algorithm. The final compressed file size of each data set will be compared to the original data file size to determine the compression file size and compression ratio. During the compression process, the clock libraries in C will be used to measure the execution time, which will allow for a benchmark to be set for the average speed of compression. Furthermore, the battery percentage shrinkage may be calculated for each compression to determine the amount of power used. Lastly, the Fourier transform on the original dataset and decompressed dataset may be performed to compare the 25% Fourier coefficients of each. This will determine whether there was any data lost and how efficient the compression process was as a python program will be written to simulate this process.
