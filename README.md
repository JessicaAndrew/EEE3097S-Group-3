# EEE3097S-Group-3
This GitHub page is used to share files that are used in the EEE3097S design project. It mainly focuses on the zlib compression algorithm as well as the AES encryption algorithm.

The different encryption algorithms used are within the Encryption folder. The different compression algorithms used are within the Compression folder.

The folder called Combined has three python files in it. CompressEncrypt.py compresses and encrpyts the inputted file. DecryptDecompress.py decrypts then decompresses the file. TestLostData.py is used to first shallow and then deep check if the orignal file and the final decompressed file match.

Note that the files used in the first stage of testing are in the Testing Data Sets folder.

The files used in stage 2 of the project are from data from the Sense HAT pushed to csv files. These files can be seen in Sense-Hat-Data folder with the names "Number of readings taken".csv
